    <p>You can use the form below to convert temperature from Celsius to Farenheit or from Farenheit to Celsius</p>
      <form name="convert" id="convert">
        <label for="temp">Type the value you want to convert: </label><input type="number" name="temp" id="temp">
        <br><br>
        <input type="button" value="Celsius to Farenheit" onclick="convertC();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <input type="button" value="Farenheit to Celsius" onclick="convertF();"><br><br>
        <input type="reset" value="Clear Form">
        <br><br>
        <label for="result">Result: </label><br>
        <textarea rows="2" cols="30" id="result" readonly></textarea>
    </form>
    <script>
    function convertC() {
        var temperature = parseFloat(document.getElementById("temp").value);

        var convertedTemp = ((9 * temperature) / 5) + 32;

        var msg = temperature + "C is " + convertedTemp + "F";

        document.getElementById("result").value = msg;

    
    }


    function convertF() { 

      var temperature = parseFloat(document.getElementById("temp").value);
      //F = (9/5 * C) + 32  
      var convertedTemp = ((9 / 5)* temperature) + 32;

      var msg = convertedTemp  + "F is " + temperature + "C";

      document.getElementById("result").value = msg;
  
    
    }


    /* Here are the steps of the code. Notice that here you have two buttons: one to convert the value the user entered 
    from C to F and the other to convert from F to C
    that is why you have two functions to make it easier!
    If the user clicks the button "Celsius to Farenheit", the function convertC() will be executed and inside the { and }
    you can see that I already wrote the code for you!!! 

    If the user clicks the button "Farenheit to Celsius", the function convertF() will be executed and inside the { and }
    of this function, here are the steps for you to write the code
    1) You will need to have a variable to receive the value the user typed in the input box with id="temp" 
    suppose you call this variable as temperature (remember that you can have the same name of the variable because 
    as you are declaring the variables inside the function they are considered LOCAL variables)
    2) You will need to use the parseFloat because temperature can come with decimals, right?
    3) As you are converting from Farenheit to Celsius, then you will need to have a variable and that variable
    will have the result of the following calculation: 5 * ((temperature - 32) / 9) which will give you the value of the temperature in Celsius
    Suppose you call this variable as convertedTemp (it also can have the same variable name as it will be LOCAL TO THE FUNCTION)
    4) Then you will have a variable that will be the message that you will show to the user 
    something as 
    var msg = temperature + "F is " + convertedTemp + "C";
    5) This msg needs to be written in the textarea of the form that has the id="result" */
